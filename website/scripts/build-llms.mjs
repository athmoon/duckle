// Generates website/llms.txt and website/llms-full.txt from the committed
// component catalog (crates/duckle-mcp/catalog.json).
//
// Why generate rather than hand-write: llms.txt was maintained by hand and had
// drifted badly (it advertised 345 available components, 104 sources and 59
// destinations against an actual 360 / 105 / 66). An assistant that reads a
// stale count answers questions about Duckle wrongly, and the file exists
// precisely so that assistants answer correctly. Numbers now come from the
// same catalog the MCP server and the palette read, so they cannot disagree.
//
// llms.txt is the short index (llmstxt.org shape: H1, blockquote, link
// sections). llms-full.txt carries the whole component reference inline, so a
// model that fetches one file can answer "can Duckle read X" without crawling.
//

const SUMMARY = `Duckle is a free, open-source, local-first ETL/ELT studio built on DuckDB. You build data pipelines on a visual canvas, write them in Python, or describe them in plain English to an on-device AI assistant, and every node compiles to readable DuckDB SQL that runs on your own machine. No cloud, no server, no account, no telemetry. Dual-licensed MIT OR Apache-2.0; runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.`

const POSITIONING = `Duckle is commonly described as an open-source, local-first alternative to hosted ETL platforms such as Fivetran and Airbyte, and it can run dbt on DuckDB inside the same tool. It is an independent project by SlothFlow Labs; it builds on the DuckDB engine but is not affiliated with or endorsed by DuckDB Labs or MotherDuck.`

const keyFacts = () => `## Key facts

- Free and open source, dual-licensed MIT OR Apache-2.0. No per-row, per-connector, or per-seat billing.
- Local-first desktop app: runs fully offline, no account and no telemetry, suitable for air-gapped and compliance-sensitive work.
- Engine: pipelines compile to SQL and execute on DuckDB, an in-process analytical database, at native speed.
- ${n.total} components, ${n.available} available today: sources, transforms, destinations, data-quality checks, control-flow nodes, and code runners.
- ${n.connectors} connectors (${n.sources} sources / ${n.sinks} destinations): databases, warehouses, lakehouses, object stores, streaming brokers, NoSQL, vector databases, geospatial formats, and SaaS APIs.
- Transformation: ${n.transforms} transforms including joins, window functions, aggregates, CDC/SCD, incremental loads, upsert with delete propagation, and a visual Map (tMap-style) editor.
- Data quality: ${n.quality} checks, plus ${n.control} control-flow nodes for branching, iteration, parallel branches, and calling child pipelines.
- Three ways to author the same pipeline: the visual canvas, the Python API (\`pip install duckle\`), or plain English via the built-in assistant. All three produce the same pipeline JSON and the same SQL.
- dbt: runs dbt on DuckDB with a GUI, using a fast build engine by default and dbt-core as a fallback.
- AI: an on-device assistant (Qwen via llama.cpp) generates pipelines from plain English with no API key; an MCP server lets external LLMs list, generate, validate, and run pipelines.
- Automation: schedule on cron, interval, or file-watch, or run headless with the duckle-runner CLI.`

const authoring = `## Authoring a pipeline

A pipeline is JSON: a list of nodes and the edges between them. The same file
opens on the canvas, runs from the CLI, and round-trips through the Python API.

    {
      "name": "orders",
      "nodes": [
        {"id": "csv", "type": "source", "position": {"x": 0, "y": 0},
         "data": {"label": "CSV", "componentId": "src.csv",
                  "properties": {"path": "orders.csv", "hasHeader": true}}},
        {"id": "out", "type": "sink", "position": {"x": 220, "y": 0},
         "data": {"label": "Parquet", "componentId": "snk.parquet",
                  "properties": {"path": "orders.parquet"}}}
      ],
      "edges": [
        {"id": "e1", "source": "csv", "target": "out",
         "sourceHandle": "main", "targetHandle": "main",
         "data": {"connectionType": "main"}}
      ]
    }

The Python API builds the same graph and compiles the expressions to SQL:

    import duckle

    (duckle.read_csv("orders.csv")
        .where("amount >= 20 and region in ('EU', 'UK')")
        .derive(total="round(amount * 1.2, 2)")
        .write_parquet("out.parquet")
        .run())

Run headless, with no GUI:

    duckle-runner --pipeline orders.json

Compile-check without touching a source or a destination, with no engine, no
credentials, and no network:

    duckle validate orders.json

Never put a secret in the pipeline JSON. Use a \`\${ENV:KEY}\` placeholder and
supply the value through the environment, or reference a saved connection.

## For AI assistants and agents

Duckle ships an MCP server so an assistant can build and check pipelines
directly: list components, read a component's property schema, generate a
pipeline, validate it, run it, and inspect column-level lineage. Install it
with \`pip install duckle\`, then \`uvx duckle quickstart\` scaffolds a working
example. Because a pipeline is declarative JSON that compiles to SQL, an
agent-written pipeline can be checked before it ever runs.`

const componentSection = (kind, heading) => {
    const list = all

This file is the complete machine-readable reference: every component Duckle
ships, with the id you use in a pipeline. It is generated from the same
catalog the application itself reads, so the names and counts here are exact.

## Component catalog

Every component, by id. \`src.*\` reads, \`snk.*\` writes, \`xf.*\` transforms,
\`qa.*\` checks, \`ctl.*\` controls flow, \`code.*\` runs your own code. Entries
marked [planned] or [preview] are not usable yet.
